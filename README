Very simple web application to demonstrate different anomalies in transaction management with different
isolation levels. <p>

MariaDB - supports:
- Dirty Read
- Non-Repeatable Read

How to Test:
After initialization the test db in docker will contain single row of product
id=1, price=2

Get All Products:
    http://localhost:8080/products

Dirty Read Scenario:
 * http://localhost:8080/dirty-read/update?id=1&price=50&name=test
 * http://localhost:8080/dirty-read/get?id=1


Non-Repeatable Read Scenario:
 *  http://localhost:8080/nonrepeatable-read/get?id=1
      (response gets unblocked by second request)
 *  http://localhost:8080/nonrepeatable-read/twiceprice?id=1
